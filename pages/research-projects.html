        <h1>Reward learning, dopamine and cortico-basal ganglia loops</h1>
<p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a class of algorithms that use different approaches to estimate the expected value of different choices in different states. They've been very successful at explaining many aspects of learning from rewards/punishments in humans and animals. In particular, phasic firing of dopamine neurons code signals related to a "reward prediction error", an essential construct of model-free (RL) algorithms, such as temporal difference learning. We think that the cortico-basal ganglia loop implement a form of this algorithm using dopamine-modulated plasticity.</p>
<p>I use computational modeling and experiments to investigate more precisely how this is implemented, and how it affects exactly how we learn and make motivated choices. Why do we have two separate pathways (the direct and indirect pathway) that apparently encode the same information in opposite ways (how much you want vs. don't want an option)? Is the redundancy perfect? Does it provide benefits in certain environments? How does it affect learning and decision making?</p>
<h1>Working memory and learning</h1>
<p>Our reinforcement learning system integrates value information over time, in an exhaustive way, but as a slow and cumulative process. However, in specific conditions, we are able to learn very quickly, simply by remembering what to do.</p>
<p>I investigate how working memory contributes to reinforcement learning, and how this process interacts with the reinforcement learning system.</p>
<h1>Structure learning</h1>
<p>A large part of learning is figuring out what to learn about: what aspects of the world matter, what others do not have an influence on what choices to make, and which should be considered as identical for the purpose of a given goal. Learning structure allows us to abstract out general rules that can be applied in different contexts, transfer knowledge to new situations, and generally speed learning.</p>
<p>I investigate how we perform such structure learning, what constrains it, and how we may benefit from it (or sometime incur costs because of it). </p>
